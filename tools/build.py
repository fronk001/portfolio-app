"""
Builds dist/, the copy of the app that GitHub Pages publishes.

    py tools/build.py

dist/ is src/ with two differences:
- sw.js gets the list of files to keep on the device, and a version made from
  their contents, so any change at all makes phones fetch the new copy;
- index.html gets the same version, which is what switches sw.js on.

Nothing personal is ever in src/: the figures come from Firebase at run time
(or, on the laptop, from the tracker's own folder through tools/serve.py).
The GitHub workflow (.github/workflows/pages.yml) runs this on every push.
Standard library only.
